## How does this work?

‚ö†Ô∏è All of these instances are targeting normal (non hardcore) characters.

Your saves come in two parts.

`profile.sav` - This contains the information for all your characters, like their experience, account rewards and inventory, for up to 5 characters

Each character in your `profile.sav` corresponds to a save file using a number and starting from 0.

Character 1 = `save_0.sav`

Character 2 = `save_1.sav`

Character 3 = `save_2.sav`

Character 4 = `save_3.sav`

Character 5 = `save_4.sav`

These save file contain your world progress info. Importantly, they are also where quest items are stored. Meaning you can load into a save with quest items.

This separation of information allows us to swap these saves using our profile by loading a save file that corresponds to the character number we want swapped in.

This means you don't need a host to do these things. Here are some quick examples.

- Open Hands for scrap and buy and sell from a stacked Cass
- Load at a checkpoint before Tal'Ratha to just farm a World Boss.
- Load at Nightweaver web with all key quest items
- Load at any location or checkpoint with a unique world state for events, items or boss kills.
- Load prepped areas that have puzzles done and/or areas explored and random drops listed.

There are lots of useful possibilities here.

All this method requires is that you have good understanding of backing up and restoring for game save files.

## How to backup saves

### Manually

Windows key + R and paste this to go to the folder where you Steam ID folder will be. Back up the whole folder.

```
C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Saved Games\Remnant2\Steam
```

### Windows Command via `cmd.exe` will backup to desktop

Windows Key ‚äû

```cmd
Xcopy "C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Saved Games\Remnant2\Steam" "C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Desktop\Remnant 2\Steam\" /v /y /i /s
```

### RemnantSaveGuardian

1. Download and install [Microsoft .NET 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) or greater
2. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Razzmatazzz/RemnantSaveGuardian/releases/latest/download/RemnantSaveGuardian.zip)
3. Unzip the latest release to a folder of your choosing (probably not the same folder where you have the game installed)
4. Run RemnantSaveGuardian.exe

To export your current save to a selected destination you do this:

## How to use these instances

‚ö†Ô∏è Turn off cloud sync for this game. If you have issues loading instances, restart steam.

![](info/cloud-sync.png)

All instances are located here <https://github.com/razeedazee/remnant2-instances/tree/main/instances>

Each instance will have 5 identical copies of the instance for each potential character.

‚ö†Ô∏è Exit to menu first or exit game. This must be done when the save is not loaded.

üî∑ The swap can be done while exited to menu. Saves are checked and loaded after loading a character.

**1:** Backup up your saves. They are located here for Steam.

```
C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Saved Games\Remnant2\Steam\<STEAMID>
```

**2:** Delete the `save_NUMBER.sav` file associated with your character. NOT your `profile.sav`

**3:** Download and swap in the instance you want with the corresponding save file

‚ö†Ô∏è Organisation is a bit of a mess but i'll fix this with a more consistent method as I go along whislt trying to make sure the instance is a survivor power level 1 to 5.

üî∑ Example: Let's say you want the [hand farm and stacked Cass shop instance](https://github.com/razeedazee/remnant2-instances/tree/main/instances/Farming/great%20sewers%20hands/Hands)

Click on the save file corresponding to the character you need to use it with. `0` for your first, in this example.

The click the download button to download this single file.

![](info/download-save.png)

Copy this save to your game save folder for Steam or Epic and replace the existing one (that you have been asked to backup multiple times by now)

**4:** Load the game and play the instance.

**5:** When done exit the game

**6:** Restore you old `save_NUMBER.sav` file, NOT your profile.sav.

You will now have an updated profile and be in your original world.

üî∑ You can host these instances for others.

## Instances Gui

A Windows forms .NET app was hacked together in Visual Studio. It's certainly a novice attempt and I'm more than happy to get feedback on why it's so poorly coded.

But, it's reasonably well thought out, tested and I've tried to prevent most gotchas like allowing people to overwrite saves without having backups. This is the real vision of the project. Using this app with a fully stocked set of instances allow anyone to access most items or events without requiring a host.

Download the repo <https://github.com/razeedazee/remnant2-instances/archive/refs/heads/main.zip>

Extract is somewhere and double click the `instances-gui.cmd`
